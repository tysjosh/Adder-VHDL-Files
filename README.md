# Adder-VHDL

1. Implement a 2-bit adder using 1-bit full adder and 1-bit half adder as components (Figure1). Describe
both components in VHDL in two implementations where components are instantiated in:
a. Block Diagram top-level file.
b. VHDL top-level file

2. Simulate and implement each project on FPGA development board.
